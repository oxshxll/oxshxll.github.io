Hello stranger,

This is the Blog of a Mexican Software Engineer and Security Enthusiast who aims to open-up to the community. Hopefully feedback, tips, and suggestions, will come afloat.

I am a bookworm and have experience on Back-End Development, looking forward to meet a future version of myself who does not get so easily hectic about UI design. I am also in love with Ruby and Rails but am currently having an affair with Go-lang.

You can [contact me][email] anytime you want.

Have a great day and happy coding!
